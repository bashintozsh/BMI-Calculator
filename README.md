Very simple BMI calculator webapp. This was my first personal project while learning JavaScript. 

Link: https://ziya-sharifli.github.io/BMI-Calculator/

How to use:

Enter your age (which doesn't do anything for now), enter weight and height. You have to enter your height in this format (x.xx cm), for example (1.82cm). You can also enter in imperial units, feet goes on top, inch goes on bottom.

TODO:

~~DONE. Make the styling better, center the whole app.~~
~~DONE Add imperial option and not just metric.~~
~~DONE. Add an error message when metric height is typed in wrong format.~~
~~DONE. Add healthy/unhealthy meter/message.~~

1. Add animations
